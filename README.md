Assignment submitted for Deep Learning module. 

#### Assignment Prompt
A standard procedure in machine learning research to understand both your data and model is to explore variants that you hypothesise might work better based on experimental observations.

To complete this task you are expected to:


1. Implement a multi-class, convolutional neural network with cross-entropy loss for the Fashion-MNIST-1 data, then fill in information regarding it into a table.
2. Iteratively make modifications to your model based on how your changes affect the *validation loss*, try to minimise it by producing nine additional variants. Note that you will need to construct one loss function without regularisation and one with regularisation, the former to obtain the loss to enter into your table and the latter to obtain your gradients, or your losses will not be comparable as you change the regulariser. It is also a good idea to plot the training and validation loss across epochs, rather than simply observing the final validation loss as the shape of the curves provide further insights into the model performance.
3. Was the lowest *test loss* obtained for model with the lowest *validation loss*? If not, why do you think this was the case?


Please refer to *Final_Q2_ASG3.ipynb* for code and answer.
